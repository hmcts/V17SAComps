# V17SAComps

The purpose of the project is to examine the obstacles in creating HMCTS User journeys from Angular 16 Standalone components.

With the release of Angular 17 it will be used to investigate the barriers to adoption within HMCTS

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.9.

The project is split into 2 parts a library and a series of test pages.  
The goal here is to show best practise and micro frontend architecture patterns using the new standalone paradigm.

This is very much a work in progress, and the individual elements have yet to be optimised for production.

Please do not modify the core library

## Tooling

If you are using the new Control Flow blocks in your templates you will need to be on WebStorm 2023.3 or later for the template linting to work correctly.

The last version of VS code I have checked is 1.83.0 the September 2023 release

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
